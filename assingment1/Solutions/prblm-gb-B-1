 1   The body  of AddTwo(x)  seems to  be inlined into  the call  of main rendering the function useless (nobody else is calling it). Then why is the definition of AddTwo(x) still there all the way till the last
pass (B-1.c.*.optimized)?
	
	 
	



2 .Is there any way to get rid of it?
	
	We can just dump those files.
