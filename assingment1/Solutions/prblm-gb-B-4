1. How many  times is the expression  (a + c) computed  in the original code (as seen in the SSA pass)? What about after the FRE pass?
	
	The expression (a+c) is caculated only once and then stored in temporary variable . And then again used for further calculations.
	After FRE pass it remains same but the variable name changes. 
	 
2. Have  there been  any more  optimizations  after FRE?  How will  you check?	 
	No there are no optimizations afer FRE.It can be checked by using vi -O B-4.c.*.ssa B-4.c.*.fre1 . Just instead of ssa the file name would vary.
	
3. Why did  we have  to put a  "return b" in  this assignment?  What if "return b" is changed to "return 0"? Will it make any difference?	

	As we have used int main() function in the start so its return type is integer so we have to return certain value .
	Even if we type return 0 it will make no difference.
