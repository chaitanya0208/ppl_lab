1.   How  do the  declarations  look in  the  GIMPLE? Specifically,  what
            happens to multiple  variables declared and initialized  on the same
            line? What happens to global declaration [int Z]?
ANS:	
	The variable that is declared at last appears first in gimple.Here, double r was declared lastly but it appears first in gimple.  	
	Similarly, for the variables that are declared on the same line, the one that is declared last appears first in gimple. 
	The global variable that was declared was initialized with 0 and is used in the program further.

2.   How are complex  expressions such as [c  = a * b +  25] broken down?
            Can you  determine a  rule as  to when  temporary variables  will be
            introduced?	
ANS:
	According to precedence rule * has higher precedence than + so it will be evaluated first.So the value of the expression (a*b)is stored in a dummy variable(_1) and further it is used.
	A general rule that can be stated will be whenever there are more complex operations to be performed than it makes use of this temporary variable.

3.   How are  floats/doubles represented in  GIMPLE? What happens  when a float/double is assigned to an integer in [Z = r]?
ANS:
	Floats/Doubles are represented in terms of e representation.When a float is assigned to an integer like Z=r the integer part of the number is considered and the integer value is assigned to Z.

4   How  reads are/writes  to the  global variable  Z performed?  Why is
            there a temporary introduced  for the statement [Z = Z  + 1] but not
            for the statements [q = Z] or [Z = p]?	
ANS:
	In case of Z=Z+1 firstly the intergral value of r is taken and then added to 1 so for complex operations it makes use of temporary variables.But for the statement Z=p or q=Z the values are directly assigned so there is no need of temporary variable.
