 1   Do you notice that each usage of local variable as an operand uses a
            suffix that can be tracked to it's assignment? Why do some variables
            have a suffix `(D)'?
            
	As c is not assigned any value so it has got (D) suffix.
-------------------------------------------	
2   Find the point in the CFG in  which the paths of the two assignments
to variable `a'  and `b' merge. You will notice  that PHI statements
have  been  introduced.  Can  you   guess  the  syntax  of  the  PHI statements?	

	It compares between the two values of the same variable.
Syntax :
	   PHI<var_i(basic_block_no),var_j(basic_block_no)> 
-----------------------------------------
3   Can you think of an example in which a PHI node merges more than two versions of a variable?
	   
	   Similar example which involves if , else if and else statements.
